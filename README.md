# Understanding Ring Puckering in Small Molecules and Cyclic Peptides

This repository contains two python scripts (RA.py and RR.py) for ring conformational analysis and ring reconstruction respectively. The data and molecule file contain precomputed puckering parameters and low energy ring conformations generated using our proposed sampling methods. The results presented in ChemRxiv (https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Understanding_Ring_Puckering_in_Small_Molecules_and_Cyclic_Peptides/12999938) can be found in Ring Analysis, Cyclic Peptide Analysis, and Sampling Performance notebook.
